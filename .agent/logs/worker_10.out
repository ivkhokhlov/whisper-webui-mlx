Added a one-command setup script that installs dependencies, installs `wtm`, prefetches the default model, and launches the server with a browser open; documented the flow and updated the tree map.

- `scripts/setup_and_run.sh`: checks macOS arm64 + Homebrew, ensures Python/Poetry/ffmpeg, installs deps + `whisper-turbo-mlx`, downloads weights/tokenizer, starts `make run`, opens `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
- `README.md`: new one-command setup section.
- `docs/dev.md`: script requirements and first-run notes.
- `docs/tree.md`: scripts listing updated.

Tests: `make test` (pass), `make lint` (pass). Logs in `.agent/logs/test_10.log` and `.agent/logs/lint_10.log`. Worker report in `.agent/worker_report.md`.

If you want to validate acceptance, run `./scripts/setup_and_run.sh` on a clean M1+ machine and confirm it installs, downloads, launches, and opens the browser.
