Implemented best‑effort Telegram delivery using env-configured bot token/chat ID, sending a completion message plus the `.txt` transcript after successful jobs with masked-token logging, and wired it into the worker completion flow. Added focused Telegram tests and documented the env vars, with the repo tree updated for the new module/tests.

Details:
- Added Telegram helpers and masking in `mlx_ui/telegram.py`, and invoked delivery after transcription in `mlx_ui/worker.py`.
- Added Telegram delivery tests in `tests/test_telegram.py` for success, missing config, and masked-log failures.
- Documented optional Telegram env vars in `docs/dev.md` and updated `docs/tree.md`.

Tests:
- `make test` (pass)
- `make lint` (pass)

Logs/report:
- `.agent/worker_report.md`
- `.agent/logs/test_11.log`
- `.agent/logs/lint_11.log`
