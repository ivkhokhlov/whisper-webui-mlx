# WORKER AGENT (3-phase harness)

You are the WORKER in a Planner→Worker→Judge pipeline.
Your job: execute `.agent/plan.md` as written, with minimal scope creep.

Non-interactive run (`codex exec`): do not ask questions. If unclear, make the smallest reasonable assumption and log it.

## Stop conditions
- If `.agent/STOP` exists: append “STOP seen” to `.agent/progress.md` and exit.
- If `.agent/DONE` exists: append “DONE seen” to `.agent/progress.md` and exit.

## Inputs you MUST read
- `.agent/PROJECT.md` (authoritative; includes TEST_CMD/LINT_CMD)
- `AGENTS.md` (repo rules)
- `docs/spec.md`
- `docs/dev.md` (if exists)
- `.agent/plan.md`
- `.agent/judge_feedback.md` (if present)
- `.agent/queue.md`
- `.agent/progress.md`
- `.agent/state.md`

## Core rules
- Implement ONLY the single task in `.agent/plan.md`.
- Do NOT mark tasks done in `.agent/queue.md` (Judge owns that).
- Prefer small, coherent changes. No big refactors unless the task explicitly requires it.
- All network-dependent logic must be best-effort with timeouts and exception handling.
- Bind server to localhost only.
- Queue must be strictly sequential: one job at a time; no parallel transcription runs.
- Never print secrets. If you need to log config, mask tokens.

## Logging
Ensure `.agent/logs/` exists.
Write/overwrite `.agent/worker_report.md` with:
- task id/title
- what changed (bullets)
- files changed (list)
- commands run + result (pass/fail)
- if failure: include a short excerpt of the error and what you think is next

Also append a WORKER entry to `.agent/progress.md` with:
- timestamp
- CODEX_ITERATION
- task id
- test + lint status summary

## Verification (must do)
Run TEST_CMD (from PROJECT.md). Capture output into a file.

Tip: to preserve exit codes with tee:
- use: `bash -lc "set -o pipefail; <TEST_CMD> 2>&1 | tee .agent/logs/test_${CODEX_ITERATION}.log"`

If LINT_CMD is set and command exists, run similarly and capture output:
- `.agent/logs/lint_${CODEX_ITERATION}.log`

If tests fail and you cannot fix quickly:
- write/update `.agent/BLOCKED.md` with exact errors + next steps
- exit (do not thrash)

## Output
Print a short summary:
- what you implemented
- test status
- pointers to worker_report + log files

mcp startup: no servers

**Locating agent documentation**

I'm accessing AGENTS and .agent/PROJECT.md files to gather details about the agent setup and project structure to inform next steps.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cat AGENTS.md' in /Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui succeeded in 77ms:
# AGENTS.md

This repo is developed using an autonomous loop (Planner → Worker → Judge) driven by `codex exec`.
Because each run starts with limited context, **durable state MUST be stored in `.agent/`**.

## Source of truth
- `.agent/PROJECT.md` — high-level constraints and commands
- `docs/spec.md` — product requirements
- `.agent/queue.md` — backlog (Judge marks tasks done)

## How to run
- Tests: `make test`
- Lint: `make lint`
- Format: `make fmt`
- Run server: `make run`

If Makefile does not exist yet, create it during bootstrap.

## Safety / security rules
- Never touch anything outside the repo root.

# PROJECT (single source of truth for the harness)

PROJECT_NAME: "whisper-webui-mlx"
REPO_KIND: "new repo"

## Brief (1–2 paragraphs)
Build a **local macOS app for Apple Silicon (M1+)** that exposes a **Web UI on localhost** to manage **offline transcription** of audio/video files using the engine from `whisper-turbo-mlx` via its CLI `wtm` (MLX). https://github.com/JosefAlbers/whisper-turbo-mlx

Turn the current console workflow (e.g. `wtm ... --any_lang=True`) into a tool that is easy to deploy on another M1+ Mac with **one command**, supports **batch uploads**, a **strictly sequential** processing queue (no parallelism), **job history + downloads**, optional **Telegram delivery of TXT results**, and (in the final phase) **live recording + chunked transcription**.

## Primary stack
Python 3.11+
- Backend/Web: FastAPI + Uvicorn
- Templates/UI: Jinja2 + minimal vanilla JS (no external CDNs; must work offline)
- Storage: SQLite (jobs metadata) + local filesystem (uploads/results/logs)
- Worker: a single sequential worker consuming a persistent queue
- Transcription: subprocess call to `wtm` with explicit language selection

## Commands (choose defaults if unknown)
TEST_CMD: "make test"

thinking
**Noting missing documentation**

The docs/spec.md file is currently missing and needs to be created or added.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cat docs/spec.md' in /Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui succeeded in 86ms:
# Spec — whisper-webui-mlx

## Goal
Create a **local-only** tool for **macOS Apple Silicon (M1+)** that provides a **Web UI on localhost** to manage **local transcription** of audio/video files using the engine from `whisper-turbo-mlx` via its CLI `wtm` (MLX).

The tool must be easy to deploy to another M1+ Mac (one command), and after the initial setup + model download it must work **fully offline**.

## MVP: Batch file transcription via Web UI
### UX
- User opens Web UI (localhost).
- User uploads **one or multiple files** (audio or video).
- User selects the **language manually** (no auto-detect).
- Files are placed into a **queue** and processed **strictly sequentially** (no parallel jobs).
- UI has:
  - Queue view: current job + pending jobs
  - History view: completed jobs + access to results

### Processing rules
- One worker processes one job at a time (sequential).
- Keep the ML model “warm” behavior in mind: avoid parallelism and avoid reinitialization churn.

**Reviewing development documentation**

# Developer guide

## Requirements (target)
- macOS Apple Silicon (M1+)
- Python 3.11+
- Homebrew (for system deps like ffmpeg)

## Quick start (eventual)
```bash
./scripts/setup_and_run.sh
```
Notes:
- Requires Homebrew (for ffmpeg), Python 3.11+, and Poetry (the script installs missing deps via Homebrew).
- First run needs network access to install `whisper-turbo-mlx` and download the default model.
- Set `SKIP_MODEL_DOWNLOAD=1` to skip prefetching weights (not recommended).

## Manual dev loop
```bash
poetry install --with dev

**Reviewing plan documentation**

I'm reading the plan file in the .agent directory to understand the current strategy and details for advancing the project.

# Plan

Task: WUI-090 - Live mode skeleton
Acceptance: UI has “Live” page stub + technical plan in docs; no implementation yet

Assumptions:
- Live mode is a UI stub only; no recording, chunking, or worker changes in this task.
- Adding a "Live" tab alongside Queue/History is acceptable.

Implementation steps:
1) Add a /live route in the FastAPI app that renders a new template with stub copy and a clear "coming soon" status.
2) Create a Jinja template for the Live page and add a navigation link/tab to it in the shared layout.
3) Document a short technical plan for Live mode (browser capture → chunking → server ingestion → sequential transcription) in docs.
4) Add a minimal test that asserts the /live page renders (and optionally that nav includes Live).
5) Update docs/tree.md if any new files are added.

Files likely to touch:
- mlx_ui/app.py
- mlx_ui/templates/base.html
- mlx_ui/templates/live.html

## Done
- [x] WUI-050 — Update check at startup (acceptance: if online, checks for updates with timeout; if offline, no errors and app works)
- [x] WUI-040 — Telegram delivery (acceptance: when env vars are set, send TXT + message; failures do not break pipeline; secrets masked)
- [x] WUI-030 — One-command setup & run on M1+ macOS (acceptance: `./scripts/setup_and_run.sh` installs deps, downloads models, starts server, and opens browser)
- [x] WUI-021 — Results browsing + download (acceptance: history page shows per-job links to view/download TXT and other generated formats)
- [x] WUI-020 — Integrate `wtm` CLI transcription (acceptance: for a job, system runs `wtm` with chosen language and produces at least `.txt` in `data/results/<job_id>/`)
- [x] WUI-012 — Sequential worker + fake transcriber (acceptance: single worker processes jobs strictly one-at-a-time; tests do not require ML model)
- [x] WUI-011 — Persistent job store (SQLite) (acceptance: jobs survive server restart; history page lists prior jobs)
- [x] WUI-010 — Upload endpoint + local storage (acceptance: user can upload multiple files; files saved under `data/uploads/` and jobs are created)
- [x] WUI-002 — Minimal WebUI shell (acceptance: localhost page renders with tabs: Queue + History, using server-side templates)
- [x] WUI-001A — Fix pytest availability for `make test` (acceptance: `make test` succeeds in a clean env by ensuring pytest is installed or Makefile uses Poetry/venv)

**Planning Live page routing and navigation**

I'm deciding whether to add the Live page as a separate route with its own template and minimal stub, and how to integrate its navigation—either by adding a new tab alongside Queue/History in the existing JS tablist or by adding a top-level nav with anchor links, noting there's no shared base layout currently.
thinking
**Evaluating base layout introduction**

I'm weighing creating a new base template to share styles and navigation between index and /live for maintainability versus duplicating nav code for minimal changes; creating a base would improve clarity but requires more restructuring, while adding a nav link to /live in the existing tablist can be done with less effort. Next, I'll review existing tests to add minimal coverage for the /live route.

**Planning live mode docs and template**

Deciding to add a new live.html template (requiring tree update) and to document the live mode plan by adding a section in an existing doc to avoid extra files and tree changes there. The template will reuse existing CSS by replicating structure to keep changes minimal and ASCII-only.
thinking
**Designing navigation integration and template strategy**

Deciding to add a new `live.html` template with duplicated header and CSS for minimal changes, plus a `/live` route. Navigation on index and live pages will include a "Live" link styled like tabs but as an anchor without JS toggling to keep semantics and accessibility simple. Considering creating a base template for shared layout but favoring minimal refactor for now. Also planning to update docs and tests accordingly.

**Planning live route addition**

I'm preparing to add a `/live` route in app.py with an HTML response and create a matching live.html template styled consistently. Commit is skipped since auto-commit isn't explicitly required.
thinking
**Designing consistent Live page navigation**

I'm planning to add a Live link styled like the existing queue/history tabs, using anchors without data-tab to avoid JS tab toggling issues, and update CSS to style anchors like tabs with no underline. I'll implement minimal query-param support in index.js for initial tab selection to improve navigation consistency.
thinking
**Finalizing tab semantics and Live page creation**

I'm resolving ARIA conflicts by adding the Live link as an anchor inside the existing tablist without full tab semantics, updating index to support query-param tab selection, and creating a separate Live page template with consistent styling and stub content. Next, I'll implement these changes via targeted patches.

**Designing live mode page**

I'm creating a simplified live.html page modeled on index.html with a similar header, CSS, and tab navigation using anchor links for Queue, History, and Live (active). The main content is a stub status card and placeholder text announcing live transcription is coming soon.
thinking
**Completing live page HTML**

The live.html page includes a placeholder description outlining the intended live transcription flow with clear ASCII-safe text and consistent indentation. Next, I'll create the file using apply_patch.

+## Live mode plan (stub)
+- Capture microphone + browser tab audio in the browser (getUserMedia + getDisplayMedia).
+- Mix streams client-side, encode, chunk into ~10s segments.
+- POST chunks to a server session endpoint with selected language.
+- Server writes chunks to disk, enqueues sequential transcription jobs via the worker.
+- UI streams partial transcript updates and saves final text to results.
+
 ## Notes
 - The app must bind only to `127.0.0.1`.
 - Keep network usage optional and best-effort (Telegram, update check).

**Confirming tab navigation and query param handling**

The index page correctly uses query params only on load to activate tabs, with queue/history buttons updating content without changing URL. The Live tab remains without a data-tab attribute and without query params, matching current behavior. Next, running tests and linting.
thinking
**Preparing and confirming test environment**

Checked formatting and logging setup; ensured logs directory exists before running tests with output captured for review. Now running the full test suite.

**Updating worker report and progress logs**

I'm preparing the worker report with task details, changes, files, and command results per the WUI-090 task, then appending an entry with timestamp, iteration, task id, and test/lint status to the progress log.

**Using here-document for file updates**

# Worker Report

Task: WUI-090 - Live mode skeleton

## What changed
- Added a /live route and a stub Live template with a clear coming-soon status and navigation.
- Added a Live link to the main tab bar and support for ?tab=queue/history on load.
- Documented the live mode technical plan in developer docs.
- Added a minimal test that asserts the /live page renders.

## Files changed
- mlx_ui/app.py
- mlx_ui/templates/index.html
- mlx_ui/templates/live.html
- tests/test_app.py
- docs/dev.md
- docs/tree.md

## Commands run
- make test (pass)
- make lint (pass)

+## Live mode plan (stub)
+- Capture microphone + browser tab audio in the browser (getUserMedia + getDisplayMedia).
+- Mix streams client-side, encode, chunk into ~10s segments.
+- POST chunks to a server session endpoint with selected language.
+- Server writes chunks to disk, enqueues sequential transcription jobs via the worker.
+- UI streams partial transcript updates and saves final text to results.
+
 ## Notes
 - The app must bind only to `127.0.0.1`.
 - Keep network usage optional and best-effort (Telegram, update check).

**Planning final summary message**

I'm outlining the final message to include implemented features, test pass status, and references to `.agent/worker_report.md`, `.agent/logs/test_13.log`, and `.agent/logs/lint_13.log` as stand-alone inline code, plus a brief summary of key changes for clarity.

**Crafting final concise summary message**

I'm preparing a clear final message that briefly explains the Live mode stub additions with key file references, confirms tests and lint passed, points to relevant reports and logs, and suggests running `make run` to preview the stub at `/live`.
codex
Added a Live mode stub page and route, linked it from the main UI, and documented the live pipeline plan so the “coming soon” entry point is visible and scoped (`mlx_ui/app.py`, `mlx_ui/templates/index.html`, `mlx_ui/templates/live.html`, `docs/dev.md`, `docs/tree.md`, `tests/test_app.py`).

Tests: passed `make test`; lint: passed `make lint`.

Reports/logs: `.agent/worker_report.md`, `.agent/logs/test_13.log`, `.agent/logs/lint_13.log`.

Next steps:
1) Run `make run` and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/live to preview the stub UI.
